<h1>Reman Co.</h1>

```
Purpose:
Reman is a technology company bringing effective equipment to reserach facilities. 

Our internal and external goal is to bring efficiency to the four core tennents of our business. The fight to stave off entropic decay is currently the longest and most important game we know of. 
1) Building (design & manufacturing)
2) Marketing (public problem & solution education)
3) Selling (resource exchange & ongoing customer relations)
4) Scaling (comany system design)

If we can increase our own abilities and those of others, that is exactly what we must do.
Ability over inability, action over inaction, understanding over ignorance.
Build the means by which you will advance further.

Make it happen! | reman.co
